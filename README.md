# Artificial intelligence
If you want to follow along not only the theoretical part of my 12. grade paper, then you are in the right place. In this Repository are exaples for Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning Tasks that you can try on your PC. It would be great if you already know something about programming, especally in Python. If you have absolutly no idea, I recomend understanding a few fundamental concepts of Programming:
* [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org)
* [codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python)

## Getting Started:
To be able to execute the examples in this Repository you'll need to install a few things first.

### IDE
An Integrated Development Enviornment (IDE) lets you write und run code in nearly all languages. There are a few popular once like [Atom](https://atom.io) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Choose the one you like the most and start Programming.
A popular choice for machine learning is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com). It contains most of the Packages that you will need and a way to run code in the cloud: Jupyter Notebooks.

### Packages
Packages contain code, that should help you to get your project done as fast as possible with the least amount of work. To execute the code in this Repository you will need:

* tensorflow: `pip install tensorflow`
* keras: `pip install keras`
* scikit-learn: `pip install scikit-learn`
* numpy: `pip install numpy`
* matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib`
* pandas: `pip install pandas`<br>

Ececute this code in you Terminal (Mac) or Shell (Windows) and it should install the proper package.
